## Story

In the jagged hills and wind-scoured plains, where twilight lingers and darkness clings to every breath, the world stands on the brink of oblivion. Long-forgotten kingdoms gasp for survival, their proud banners stained by relentless conflict. The bitter taste of iron hangs thick in the air, and whispers of betrayal echo through deserted corridors. This is the realm of Knights of Darkness—a somber age where survival hinges upon unity, yet ambition and fear forever threaten to tear alliances apart.

From the mist-shrouded highlands of Aurewynd, whose castles loom like silent sentinels against brooding storm-clouds, to the desolate wastes of Valemire, where salt-laden winds sculpt the bones of ancient monuments, each kingdom knows its neighbor’s strength as well as its hidden frailties. Scarred by decades of siege, starvation, and plague, these lands can no longer endure solitary struggles. Kings and queens, once sworn enemies sworn to eradicate each other’s bloodlines, now hold hushed audiences in torchlit halls. Here, words become blades, and treaties are forged with an uneasy blend of respect and suspicion.

Amid the gloom, rumors spread of a rising terror: an unholy legion said to inhabit the western frontier, where the horizon is forever choked by heavy clouds. Survivors speak of monstrous silhouettes glimpsed at dusk—armies of gaunt soldiers who move without sound or mercy. Though no living soul can confirm the exact nature of this threat, caravans vanish overnight, outposts are found abandoned, and entire villages are reduced to ash. These events stir fear in the hearts of those who would otherwise spit on the notion of cooperation, forcing old rivals to contemplate uneasy truces.

Yet alliances are only as strong as the devotion of those who bind them. Bitter grudges fester behind forced smiles, and the impetus to form coalitions is rarely born of true unity. Instead, it is forged from desperate pragmatism: better to stand side by side against a looming cataclysm than be devoured one by one by the horrors lurking beyond the horizon. In the halls of power, ambassadors gather in the flickering glow of torches, their parchments emblazoned with seals from warring houses. Promises of trade, military support, and safe passage are bartered for subtle advantages—realms weigh each other’s loyalty against the inevitability of future betrayals.

Even among these alliances, different coalitions vie for dominance. Some see themselves as chosen protectors of the land, believing only their cause is righteous enough to shield humanity from annihilation. Others revel in cunning stratagems, twisting fragile accords to further their private agendas. Rival coalitions clash not merely on the battlefield but also in the delicate dance of politics: each side schemes to gain the upper hand, deploying secret emissaries, forging clandestine pacts, or even courting the very darkness they claim to oppose. In these uneasy times, victory belongs to those who excel at both diplomacy and warfare.

Wander the kingdom roads at dusk, and you may catch a glimpse of haggard sentries perched atop city walls, eyes hollow from too many sleepless nights. Torches cast flickering halos on damp stones, revealing cracks in fortress gates that once appeared impregnable. In nearby hovels, peasants huddle around dying embers, haunted by the knowledge that hope is a scarce commodity. Many have watched loved ones fall in fruitless battles, or starve during endless winters. Despite all, rumors of heroic deeds continue to spread—stories of unknown warriors rallying war-torn villages, of knights returning from distant lands with new forms of steel to share, or of wise scholars who decipher warnings from ancient tomes.

It is within this crucible of desperation and determination that you step forward. As a newly anointed champion, your blade will be tested not only by how well it slices through flesh and mail, but by the wisdom with which it is wielded. Will you swear fealty to a single cause, forging bonds of loyalty as unbreakable as the swords you carry? Or will you dance between conflicting interests, securing power in secrecy and weaving your own grand design? Every choice you make will shape not only your own destiny, but the fate of entire realms caught in an unending twilight.

The darkness hungers for fear, thrives on division, and delights in seeing proud kingdoms crumble under their own mistrust. Yet it also gives rise to unforeseen heroes who emerge from the most unlikely corners. In Knights of Darkness, it is your courage, your cunning, and your resolve that will determine whether these lands embrace the last glimmer of hope or plunge forever into shadow. Gather your allies, pledge your blade, and remember: unity is a fragile shield. In a world ruled by fear and kept alive by trembling coalitions, only the boldest and most steadfast hearts can save all that remains from the ravenous jaws of night.
