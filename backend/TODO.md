# Dump list for what needs to be fixed

## Missing major game features
1. Attacks

1. Spies
1. Rankings and statistics
1. Player registration
1. Firing of professionals when there is not enough buildings
1. Exiling of people when there is not enough houses, including professionals
1. Messages

## Problems

1. Creating market offer should have minimum value
1. Small kingdom bonus should be based on used land instead of total land
1. We do a lot of calculations for small kingdom bonus, maybe we should have a table of consts for each land value?

## Ideas

1. Profession profile, it should inform building and training UI
1. Random Events? Might not be the best idea
1. Warning on passing turn with negative implications
